ParkingSpace
============

Tired looking for a parking space in and around downtown in the major cities? or Have a parking space in your apartment which is lying vacant for eons?  Parking Place is a one touch solution to help find out parking spots in the vicinity of where you are looking to park your vehicle. The prices that you pay will be much lesser depending on the hours of parking. Park more and pay less is the tagline here. 

How the app works ?

There are two different modes in the application. The first one is the User Mode which serves the person who is looking for a parking space. The second one is the Owner Mode where the owner of the parking space will put up an ad with the phone number and price details. Everything works on the Google Maps. As soon as the user enters the application, the current location of the user is shown and then there are two options are provided. The options are rendered as buttons, where the first is called the Owner Mode and the second is called the User Mode. When the user clicks on the User Mode, the parking spaces close to his vicinity are shown. When the Owner clicks on the Owner Mode, the owner can enter the details about the address of the parking space, the price of the parking and the phone number to contact.
